I accrued some medical debt within the last two years.  <br><br>I used my credit cards to cover the medical expenses my insurance didn't cover.  I am in excellent condition now.  I am slightly surprised about the score Transunion gave me.  I have been running my three credit reports and scores monthly through Experian for the last year and my score always averages 725 - 739 for all three Credit Reporting Agencies.  When checking my credit report directly through Transunion, my score was lower.  <br><br>I am in the process of consolidating my student loans.  The consolidation should be complete by the end of December.  I am consolidating them, not for payment reasons, but to increase my credit score with less installment accounts showing on my credit report.  The student  loan payment is $161 per month and in good standing.

To pay off an old loan with an unfavourably high APR of 24.99%. The payoff amount for this loan is $4,039 (as of 12/22/11, the date this loan would potentially fund).<br><br>2. For home repairs. My condo received some water damage during Hurricane Irene, which was worsened by rain storms during the following months. The entire building was affected and the condo board is co-ordinating repairs to finish in Spring 2012, but in order to cover the costs of this, each unit owner is requested to pay a special assessment in January 2012. My share of this is $4,164.<br><br>3. The remainder of the loan is to finance home improvements which I plan to coincide with the repairs in order to take advantage of the contractors already being there, and save some money. I plan to add a room and upgrade my rusting old boiler for an on-demand one to be more energy efficient. Quotes I've received for this range from $4,000-$5,000, so the total loan amount leaves a little buffer in case of unforeseen extra costs during the work, which is usually the case when dealing with contractors!<br><br>I am an executive with a very stable job for a company that is well-insulated from the economic problems.

While the numbers crunch out to a D2 loan, let me take you beyond the numbers and show you how this is not your typical D2 loan.  The funds from this loan will be used strictly to pay down debts which carry significantly higher interest rates.  I experienced some life events in the past that caused the current situation.  I have worked hard to improve credit score and pay down the debts but with the interest rates so high its a real struggle.  I have been employed for 15 years with the same company (Fortune 50) so I have a stable work history.  As a result of my steady work history, I do not miss a payment which is one of the reasons why I qualify for this loan.  My current budget for debt repayment is $1,300 and this loan will reduce that to about $800 which will free up much needed cash to pay down the remainder of my debt faster and ensure that I provide you the return on your investment as agreed.  I am a good borrower because I have a steady history of paying my bills on time, very stable work history, clearly can afford the payments and I much rather pay you the not-so-great interest of 17% than to pay a greedy, unscrupulous giant credit card company.  You make money, I save money and credit card companies lose money. win-win!""",debt_consolidation,Consolidation,641xx,MO,4.96,0.0,Dec-1995,3.0,,,6.0,0.0,10984.0,84.5,9.0,f,0.0,0.0,18462.0400079,18426.58,13000.0,5462.04,0.0,0.0,0.0,Apr-2015,5992.22,,Jan-2016,0.0,,1.0,INDIVIDUAL,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I do plan to serve another 13 years to complete a full 20 year military career.  I plan to use the funds to consolidate credit card debt and low balance fixed payment debts. My job is very stable as the financial services industry is in high demand of risk and compliance professionals in lieu of the numerous regulations imposed on the industry.

After factoring in the monthly payment amount into my monthly budget, and I will have no issues meeting my monthly obligations.  Also, being a member of the U.S military, especially an officer, the Army will not allow any of my debts to go into a delinquency status. The military will garnish my wages and provide them to creditors until the debts are paid, which can be seen as a little extra security in terms of repayment.

I would like to thank all the investors who have already responded to my posted loan request. <br><br>I would like to provide more information in the hopes my full posted loan request is funded.<br><br>For five years, a snowball effect of financial mishaps and hardships has occurred. Some I could have avoided; some I could not. Bottom line, I have been unsuccessful gaining control of my debt because many of these debts are carried with high interest rates.  I have been unsuccessful negotiating lower interest rates with my creditors. I recently developed a spreadsheet listing all my debt. I had a rude awakening when I was able to see of my $721 monthly credit payments, $251 is toward interest (35%). <br><br>The purpose of requesting a $12,000 loan is to finance my high interest debt into a low interest loan. Through this loan, and paying off high interest debt, I project my monthly credit payments to be $675 with $130 towards interest (19%), allowing me the opportunity to comfortably pay off my debt in about three years. <br><br>I have been placing money into a savings account (difficult to access) for unplanned financial mishaps and hardships with the goal of avoiding the use of credit cards (I have cut them up!). <br><br>I have a secure job within a financially sound healthcare organization which I have been employed for ten years. Spring 2012, I enrolled in College with the goal of acquiring a degree in Accounting.  I am currently carrying a 3.88 GPA. I plan to graduate June 2013. Through College business classes I have learned how I CAN improve my financial situation.<br><br>I am loyal with my credit payments. However, I would prefer the opportunity to have most my monthly credit payments applied towards the principal so I can pay my debt off sooner.

If I get this loan I would use the additional monthly income available to me to pay off my car even faster and also to increase my savings account.  Also I will not use my credit cards any more.  I have enough cash that I will not need to use them. If I can't afford it with cash, I will not buy it.  Thanks for looking at my loan, I would very much appreciate any amount of funding that you may provide.<br>",debt_consolidation,Debt Consolidation,168xx,PA,21.87,0.0,Nov-1999,0.0,28.0,,22.0,0.0,13034.0,59.8,30.0,f,0.0,0.0,19583.5800315,19583.58,15000.0,4583.58,0.0,0.0,0.0,Dec-2014,559.73,,Jan-2016,0.0,,1.0,INDIVIDUAL,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This loan is for working capital for a whiskey bar and music venue. We feature drinks and cocktails that hearken back to the Prohibition and Big Band eras, in a return to the elegance of that time. We are the only bar in several towns with a full-size music stage, and we feature at least one band every weekend (mostly blues, bluegrass and rockabilly, although we have had other styles in). We would like to expand into having bands every Friday and Saturday night, as well as an open mic during the week. The owner has experience running a tavern, and he has tons of great ideas for expansion. In addition, he has created jobs for eight other people by starting this business, to say nothing of supporting local bands. The business is up and running, but we are in need of working capital for things like advertising and paying for bands. It is a classy place, and we're already starting to make a name for ourself in our town. We're doing our part to revitalize our downtown area. The owner is already a member of the Chamber of Commerce, and we participate in city chamber events. I have been at my job for over fourteen years, so our ability to repay is secure.

I have paid off and purchased several cars.  I have paid off a dental loan in full.  In the past five years I have not missed a single payment or paid late on any of my credit lines.  I work in a large medical group in California.  I have been there for three years and have no intention of leaving the practice.  Before this current position, I was with my last employer for two years. I was laid off during the financial crash of 2008.  My monthly budget can more than cover the repayment amount, I may even be able to pay the loan off early.  I am normally very stable.

So, as I mentioned in the title, I pretty much have free reign to do as I please.  It's been a <br><br>year now and it's time to get moving on it; there's 2000 square feet of nothingness back there.  I've applied the <br><br>appropriate herbicides to clear the wild brush and I've tilled and turned most of the land myself.  Now I need materials <br><br>and resources.  I'm currently taking bids for small pools.  Not sure if I'll go that route as they can get quite expensive, <br><br>but it's a bit of a dream.  I'm definitely doing a paverstone covered patio and some serious landscaping.  A moderate <br><br>fountain/pond is in the plans, as well. <br><br>I'm a good borrower because the trend of my life over the past five years would indicate such.  Five years ago, my credit <br><br>score was very poor.  It's currently plenty good enough for my listing to be accepted.  I've worked very hard since a short <br><br>tenure of financial ignorance to establish my creditworthiness.  I keep track of every dollar.  I can tell you the <br><br>remaining balances on all my debts, when payment on them is due, and the minimums required.  <br><br>I'm comfortable in the $650.00 payment range.  The initial lending club offer when I submitted my data was $25000.00 for <br><br>five years, paying $638.00 monthly.  I chose the alternate three-year, $20000.00 offer, paying $668.00 payment because it <br><br>just seemed like a better situation for all, including investors.<br><br>I've been in the same industry for four years now.  Work is stable and is expected to be for some time to come.<br><br>Thank you all for your consideration.

I received a loan through lending club back in May to help with one part of my debt consolidation plan.  As I have moved forward some teaser rates have expired on my cards and interest rates are really bogging me down in trying to get ahead on the revolving debt.<br><br>I, like many others have had some big expenses (unforseen), and took advantage of some teaser rates to try and get ahead.  I did not accomplish what I set out to do.  So I am reaching out to the lending club community again.  I have tried (unsuccessfully) to negotiate with the banks, but they really won't budge at this juncture.<br><br>My plan is to consolidate 2 cards 1 with $7,000 (approx) outstanding and 1 with about $5,500 outanding into 1 payment (Lending Club) whereby the monthly amount I am paying back will be less than the monthly revolving.<br><br>I have been employed for 6 years and have a steady job at BOA.  I also plan to use any tax returns, etc to help accelerate paying this and my other debts off early.<br><br>I have paid every lending club payment on-time and will continue to do so.  Again, I would much rather take out the middle man and have a fixed amount to pay with a fixed term (this ensures I do not fall into this trap again).  Also, I have cut up the cards and have reverted to a strict budget with a &quot;cash&quot; only philosophy.  <br><br>Thank You again for your time and consideration!<br> Borrower added on 11/26/11 > Additional information...I have a 1900 month mortgage (waiting for HARP 2 for a possible refinance), 400 a month car payment, plus the revolving and utilities.  Consolidating this will give me the peace of mind of having a fixed amount over a fixed period.  <br>",debt_consolidation,Debt Consolidation 2,282xx,NC,23.7,0.0,Apr-1996,3.0,,,16.0,0.0,61575.0,57.1,40.0,f,0.0,0.0,21096.3924829,20955.83,15000.0,6096.39,0.0,0.0,0.0,Jun-2015,6203.71,,Jun-2015,0.0,,1.0,INDIVIDUAL,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I made a mistake in having too many credit cards and I simply do not wish to go down that route again. With the situation of banks right now, they do not want to lend a large dollar amount to anyone regardless of credit history. I have always kept above a 720 credit score for as long as I have had credit history. More recently it has come down slightly, not because I have been late or anything, but because my balances are high. I ALWAYS pay my bills on time and have NEVER had any late or delinquent payments. I am a worthy borrower not only because of my credit history, but because I also believe that if you spend it, you must pay it back. I personally do not believe in not paying my bills. I have a full time VERY stable job and make decent money, the minimum payment on this loan is actually less than my minimum payments per month on all of my current credit cards, so there is no problem in you getting your investment back plus interest. I regard my credit scores very highly and I would not jepordize my credit history because I just decided I did not want to pay for things I purchased, that is quite immoral. I would simply like to have one payment and close out all the little cards so I can have a little piece of mind.

The Air Force does not allow us to go bad on our bills. We can lose our job for debts not paid off.

Also, we are paying a higher monthly amount on a car loan. By consolidating the car loan with the home improvement loan, we are aiming at having just one lower, comfortable monthly payment for both things.<br><br>I've been at my current employer's  for over 15 years. Since we've been advised to do the remodels to the home before we move in, we are still in our rental. In the area of expenses, I'm currently paying $1,250 in rent (last rent payment will be in Dec. 2011) and $573 on our car loan. Our only debts are the car loan (we only have one car) and our brand new mortgage of just under $650 (principal and interest). Our first mortgage payment is due in Jan 2012. By paying off the car loan and consolidating this amount with the home improvement amount, I will only have to pay $548 for my full loan with Lending Club. This means that it will be easy for me to pay back the loan without any problems at all.<br><br>In the past, we ran into some financial problems because (1) we did not budget for expenses, (2) we had no savings set aside, and (3) we often spent more than we earned--either because of mismanagement or unforeseen expenses/emergencies. Happily, a couple of years ago, we took a personal finance managing class that equipped us with the knowledge and insight we needed to change our habit and become good money managers. Now, (1) we have a budget and we stick to it; (2) we set aside savings every month for large upcoming expenses and for emergency deductibles; and (3) we don't buy much on credit at all, and when we do, we pay off any credit card statement balances by due date.<br><br>I will be happy to answer any other questions you may have.

The interest on the outstanding balance is currently 0%, but will increase to 18.99% next month. The proposed loan will have a more favorable pricing structure.  A majority of my revolving and some installment debt is the result of a large tax liability (capital gains). My financial advisor urged me to pull from all of my personal resources in order to pay the liability as soon as possible, so I used my savings (except for emergency fund) and some debt to pay the liability in full. One of my installment loans is related to an executive graduate program. My former employer paid for the tuition and related expenses, subject to me remaining with the organization for 2 years after graduation. If I were to leave prior to that time a pro-rated balance of the tuition was to be converted into a note payable. I accepted a new position prior to the two year period, and the balance was converted to a note. My current employer reimburses me for both the monthly payment on the note (approximately $472), and the remaining expenses associated with the executive degree. I am currently in the process of paying off all debt, which should be accomplished by the 1st quarter of 2013. I will continue to pay down the higher interest facilities, and then roll the amount I was paying on an obligation once it has been paid off to the next obligation (snowball effect). My monthly budget provides sufficient excess funds from which Im able to pay debt at accelerated rate. I have been in the finance industry for 12+ years, focusing on senior secured lending, leveraged transactions, workout and restructure, and more recently consultation on M&A activity (primarily purchasing distressed assets). My unique skill set affords me a great deal of flexibility in both times of economic expansion and contraction. I have never been late on a payment, let alone defaulted on an obligation. The proposed loan will allow me to repay a significant portion of my exiting debt priced at a higher rate, and accelerate my plan to be debt free w/in the next few years.

Some credit cards were at a 0% promotion and now have jumped to 24.99% APR. I am looking to consolidate my debt. My bills and rent are always paid on time. This will not only reduce my interest rate but consolidate my bills into one payment. My goal is to rent out this house as additional income on top of my full-time job. <br> Borrower added on 11/23/11 > To answer a few questions posed:<br><br>I have worked at my current place of employment for over 2 1/2 yrs. I pay all my bills on time and usually try to pay more than required. As stated above, I have two credit cards with @24.99% APR that I would like to pay off with the 18.25% loan.<br><br>The credit cards originally had a 0% APR for cash advances. This was used for a down payment on the house. It was not from frivolous spending. Before the cash advance, my credit cards had low balances which I'd pay off before the end of the month.<br><br>As for my monthly budget:<br><br>Housing cost: about $500 + $50 util. <br>Credit Cards: $500/mos. Which would be transferred to loan payments, when CC's are paid off with loan<br>Transportation: $100<br>Food/Misc.: $300<br><br>I hope this helps. Please feel free to send further questions.

I've been at my job for 22 years.  My job is stable, and i'm a senior employee.  I can use cards only as needed.  I'm older now, so i need to make serious changes.

An allowance of 5-10% overage has been built into budget. These projects will significantly add to home value. The property in question is a two-family home in a prime real estate location where values have not fallen by any significant degree. I currently live on the second floor and have a long-term, reliable tenant on the first floor. My aim is to bring the house up to its full potential through these projects and then keep the property indefinitely. Funds from the loan will also free up existing cash on hand, which will be used to eliminate other existing credit balances. I am self-employed as a freelance translator and over the course of eight years of experience in my current role I have never had any shortage of work; because of my position as a B2B service provider for critical sectors such as heavy industry, pharmaceutical, and IT, demand is diversified and constant. I have top professional ratings and excellent credit history, and have secured quality professionals to undertake the project at hand at a fair price.

A tree fell on my house during a storm in April and I took advantage of the rebuilding to remodel my kitchen and add a small addition to my house.  The total budget is $80,000.  Insurance is paying about $50,000 and I am paying the remainder.  I have already paid $10,000 and have asked for more money than the budget just in case the contractor goes over budget.  I plan to pay off this loan early.  I get my bonus from work in May and will be able to pay back $15,000.  The remainder I will pay off monthly.

In order to do that we are donating 10% of every league fee, camp, tournament, and ad sponsorship. But instead of trying to get our customers excited about causes we are passionate about, we are going to become passionate about the causes they already care about. That is why we are letting our customers choose what cause they want their 10% to support. So we???ve decided to stand for action rather than any particular cause. We want to have fun and give back to our world. We believe that the best feeling in the world is the joy of giving and we want to give that gift to our customers. We want to create a community around giving and goodwill. We invite you to be part of our vision and community by becoming an investor today. Financial: Our monthly expenses are less than $2,000 including rent, insurance, utilities, etc. Each league we run will generate $2,500 each month. We plan to start with three leagues this December. We will also run soccer camps, rent out the field, and sell ad sponsorship packages in the arena to generate additional income. Construction Status: We have installed over 17,000 square feet of artificial turf. All permits are completed and approved. We???re ready to install the dasher boards.

I have a steady paycheck (active duty military) and will have a steady paycheck till the day I die (after retirement) therefore, you do not ever have to worry about a missed, late or no payment (your money is as sure as the sun coming up every morning).<br/>",debt_consolidation,OUT OF DEBT,902xx,CA,22.55,0.0,Apr-1995,0.0,,,10.0,0.0,32559.0,82.0,29.0,f,3370.74,3365.46,17647.71,17620.16,12629.26,5018.45,0.0,0.0,0.0,Jan-2016,353.58,Feb-2016,Jan-2016,0.0,,1.0,INDIVIDUAL,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thank you for considering my consolidation loan. Consolidating my 23% debt into an 11.71% rate is obviously a good move and will help me attain my goal of becoming debt-free more quickly.<br/><br/>As soon as my loan is approved, I will set up an automatic draft from my bank account. It will be paid automatically the day after I receive each of my paychecks. Therefore, there is no chance I would ever be late on a payment.<br/><br/>My job is extremely stable. I work in a small business that has been in existence for more than 25 years. We have approximately 20 employees. The contracts that comprise my nearly $200,000 portfolio have been signed for three year extensions or are already self-renewing each year. Even if I were to lose any contracts, which is unlikely given my service ratings (and the fact that I've never once lost a contract), the owner of the company would not let me go. We receive more requests for proposal than we can service at this time, so there is never a lack of contracts to serve.<br/><br/>I am willing to provide any additional information or details that is requested of me. Again, I appreciate your consideration.<br/> Borrower added on 11/07/11 > I would like to add that I am consolidating debt to lower the rate and pay it off more quickly.  I do not want people to think I am seeking to consolidate because I have been missing payments.  I have never missed or been late with a payment.  I ensure my bills are set up automatically though my bank account on a recurring basis so that I don't risk letting a payment slip my mind.  My payments to this loan would replace those other bills, and I'd set the payments up automatically.<br/>",debt_consolidation,debt consolidation loan,276xx,NC,21.98,0.0,Apr-2001,0.0,,,14.0,0.0,21358.0,59.0,32.0,f,0.0,0.0,23472.0167629,23128.98,18825.0,4647.02,0.0,0.0,0.0,Apr-2015,3584.73,,Apr-2015,0.0,,1.0,INDIVIDUAL,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, the loan represents absolutely no change in my budget while allowing me to pay off debts much faster at lower interest rates.  <br/><br/>My payment history with all my accounts reflects both my commitment to honor my obligations and my ability to do so.  My budget also attests to my ability to fulfill the terms of this loan. I currently have a total non-secured monthly debt payments to income ratio of 24.82%.  Auto, rent and bill/utility payments constitute an additional 29.31%.<br/><br/>Furthermore, my employment is secure.  My employer has been in business for 8+ years.  I transitioned from a former employer in order to be with my current employer when the company was launched.  The company has no debt, a significant percentage of its annual revenues as savings, and services the consulting needs of Fortune 500 clients in a specific area for which all such companies budget and spend.  During the last 3 financially-difficult years for the economy, my employer has continued to grow amidst an industry that on average has seen double-digit declines in revenues.  Additionally, sizable investments have been made in developing international distribution channels for our intellectual property from which are seeing solid, ongoing dividends.<br/><br/>Please contact me with any additional questions you may have.

Local Internet marketing is on the rise because old media techniques are less effective, while most people are now finding businesses on the Internet. Small business owners need help navigating this type of marketing because it is technical and there is a learning curve.

Alternately, we will manage these accounts on behalf of the company. Participating in Social Media can be time-consuming, but it is also crucial.

I've always been a responsible person, but things piled up quickly when my dream job at a great nonprofit collapsed in the fall of 2008. This job paid me well, and was something I had worked toward for years. Unfortunately, as a fairly new organization, the timing of the bank crises that year led to a serious shortage of incoming revenue when we were between projects and needed it most.<br/><br/>I was forced to live off of my credit cards for months until finding a new job, which was a major lifestyle adjustment. I've gotten back on my feet, but I can barely make enough to pay off my bills, and the high interest rates are killing me. I feel sick every time I see how much money I'm paying to the big banks every month in fees and interest, and I'm excited about using Lending Club to get out from under that terrible cycle. The way this works makes me feel like I'll be proud to pay this off (since it's going to normal people), instead of resentful that the banks (who were bailed out by our government) will continue to line their pockets with my money. I assure you that your investment will be sound! I'm genuinely pumped to get this going and get out from under the banks.<br/><br/>Thanks so much!<br/>",debt_consolidation,Saying goodbye to credit card debt,554xx,MN,19.88,0.0,Dec-1998,0.0,37.0,,8.0,0.0,16101.0,48.9,22.0,f,0.0,0.0,15991.9616846,15991.96,14000.0,1991.96,0.0,0.0,0.0,Sep-2014,1333.69,,Oct-2014,0.0,,1.0,INDIVIDUAL,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have been able to successfully pay off significant home-related debt (initial remodeling, plumbing replacements, etc) in less than a year following 2 promotions (one with my civilian job, the other with my military reserve career) and I'm benefiting from yet another overseas deployment, so I want these things gone!  This will free up cash to finish paying off another debt in the next 90 days before returning to the US.  Excellent payment history - I see no need to stick with a store card (Sears, 17%, used to replace roof on home thus increasing value of property; purchased at $210K in 2009) and a regular credit card (Chase, 23%, they raised it years ago and I have never been able to argue them down, regardless of impeccable payment history and credit score).  I opted for the short-term 3 year loan; I see no need to extend payments if you don't need to.  I appreciate Lending Clubs ease of use, so I opted to use LC again (I have a current loan at 6% for an emergency pool cave in/repair last summer) after failing to find another option that can compare to the quick financing, initial interaction with potential lenders (Q&amp;A when initially funding the loan), and competitive rates.  Other options on the web did not meet the threshold to satisfy the two debts I listed above, or their interest rates were equally abysmal.  I hope this answers some questions up front.

And this loan will be an important key in the success of my life changing goals.  I plan to use these funds to pay down credit card debt, student loan debt and I am also thinking about using a small portion for something very personal that will change my life forever.  I know I am going to be a great borrower due to the fact that, as I have stated, I take great pride in my financial well-being.  Also, I work for a bank in a department that deals with helping homeowners.  This experience has without a doubt opened my eyes to what can happen when money and budgets are not managed correctly and/or logically, therefore I know what it truly means to be a good borrower to any financial institution that lends money.  My Monthly budget is a simple one, most of my debt is from a couple of credit cards, 1 installment loan, student loans and my rent, which is not a lot because I have 2 roommates and that helps to keep the living expenses down considerably.  I have a car that is completely paid off and is in great condition.  I would be more than happy to answer any questions regarding my monthly budget if more detail is required.  As I have stated I am employed at a Bank, and I feel that after 7 years of working at the bank, I know I have a very stable job.  I was just recently promoted to a much more important role, and this promotion is more proof of how stable my job is and also demonstrates a little more of how I will be a good borrower.  I would like to say Thank You for this opportunity that has been provided by Lending Club, I truly think this is a great business and am looking forward to being a part of it.<br/>",debt_consolidation,Debt Consolidation Loan,146xx,NY,13.1,0.0,Dec-1999,0.0,31.0,,11.0,0.0,2374.0,37.6,17.0,f,0.0,0.0,6762.68,6480.82,6000.0,762.68,0.0,0.0,0.0,Mar-2013,3802.79,,Mar-2013,0.0,,1.0,INDIVIDUAL,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We spent over $45 Billion in 2010 on our pets and it is estimated to surpass $50 Billion in 2011, doubling what was spent in 2001.<br/>Analysts report that even during the recent economic slowdown; pet owners are still pampering their pets. This trend is expected to continue at a rate of 9%+ per year.<br/><br/>When we must leave our pets behind, we want a clean, safe and caring boarding facility. Most pet owners expect more than a cage and 2 walks a day&hellip;We want our pets to enjoy themselves in a secure facility that is friendly, fun and peaceful.  Also, families are opting for active doggie daycares to offer their pets a chance to socialize and exercise while they work.<br/><br/>As Florida&rsquo;s population expanded over the last 10 years, luxury pet boarding and day care facilities have not kept up with the pace. We feel that there is an unmet need in our community.<br/><br/>We propose opening a luxury pet boarding and pet daycare facility with indoor and outdoor exercise enclosures.<br/><br/>Service Description<br/><br/>Pet Boarding: A minimum of 30 suites for overnight pet guest 365 days a year. We will offer a variety of luxury indoor accommodations with flat screen TV, climate-control and 24 hour staff to monitor the facility. 	    <br/><br/>Overnight fees will range from $30.00 to $50.00 per 24 hour stay, plus additional fees such as Playtime, Pup-Corn &amp; Movie, Yappy Hour, Twist &amp; Treat Yummy, Daycare Workout, Going Home Bath and more.<br/><br/>Doggie Daycare: We will provide the ultimate dog daycare service Monday thru Sat. Allowing each pet to exercise with our staff and socialize with other pets of similar disposition.<br/> 		   <br/>Daycare fees will range from $15.00 for a half day to $25.00 for a full day. We will offer pre-paid discounts packages for our regular customers.<br/><br/>Financial Potential<br/><br/>Based on analysis of local boarding rates and average occupancy, we project gross revenues of $171,720.00 during the first year, based on combined revenues from boarding and daycare operations. This projection is based on an average occupancy of 50% annually.<br/><br/>Operating expenses, including employees are projected to be 70% of gross revenue, generating a $51,416.00 pre-tax profit the first year. <br/><br/><br/>List of Major Start-up Expenses:<br/><br/>Paid From Start-up Capital<br/>Lease Deposit		$  7,500.00<br/>License/Permits		$  1,000.00<br/>Utility Deposits		$  1,000.00<br/>Insurance		$  1,000.00<br/>Pet Boarding Area		$18,000.00<br/>Miscellaneous 		$ 5,000.00<br/> Total		$33,500<br/>",small_business,Pet Boarding,336xx,FL,5.47,0.0,Nov-2004,0.0,,,4.0,0.0,6572.0,78.8,9.0,f,0.0,0.0,9011.45827058,9011.46,8000.0,1011.46,0.0,0.0,0.0,Dec-2014,257.19,,Nov-2014,0.0,,1.0,INDIVIDUAL,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Every 5 years, the commercial lender requires a refinance.  Because of the housing market downturn, the lender did refinance the loan in January 2011, but is requiring a $20,000 principal paydown in 18 months.  This year, I have paid down $7,000 on the principal along with the monthly payments of $900.  The purpose of this loan is to pay the balance of the principal requirement now which will create a larger margin of cash flow for the next 3 years.  The property is not upside down.  I purchased it for $175,000 and owe $102,000.  They did not require an appraisal for the refinance.  All three units have been remodeled since I purchased the property.  One occupant has been with us since 2006.  The other 2 have lived there since 2007.  They are stable tenants and always pay their rent on time.<br/><br/>Some information about me:  I work full-time for an investment firm in their technology area.  I have been with this company for 10.5 years.  I also work part-time as a sales associate.  I am a hard worker, diligent and focused.

I am planning to pay it off before the interest is added. I applied for it right before having an elective surgery. I knew I could pay it before the interest piles on so I was ok with that. I did that same thing with empire today and paid it off before the interest was added. All I want to do is combine my credit cards and pay them off faster.

When I saw that I told them there is no way. My cards are a lot less than that and it would have been crazy to go through with it. I hadn't checked on only borrowing $15000, like I changed to with you guys. It leaves me still oweing Bank of America but I am totally okay with that. It's not hard to keep up with what I owe them. I see it every time I sign on. I also have my house loan with them. Please let me know as soon as you can on this.
